# Automated Robot Markup Syntax
Markup syntax for generating files for use in multiple robotic simulation environments.

## About
Much like Markdown is used for easily formatting and creating stylized text. ARMS's goal is to create a simple and easily modifiable syntax for robot specifications across many simulation environments. So instead of learning the APIs of multiple environments, anybody can just learn ARMS and have the files needed to get their robot into their chosen environment.

The first environment ARMS will target is the Open Dynamics Engine. https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode/overview
