# Automated Robot Markup Syntax
Markup syntax for generating files for use in multiple robotic simulation environments.

## About
Much like Markdown is used for easily formatting and creating stylized text. ARMS's goal is to create a simple and easily modifiable syntax for robot specifications across many simulation environments. So instead of learning the APIs of multiple environments, anybody can just learn ARMS and have the files needed to get their robot into their chosen environment.

The first environment ARMS will target is the Open Dynamics Engine. https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode/overview

## Getting Started

### To run Armature:
- Install toml
> pip install toml
- Run:
> python Armature.py my/file/location.toml where/I/want/to/save

#### To see ODE in action:
- Open Visual Studio 2017
- Click File/Open/File...
- Navigate to AutomatedRobotMarkupSyntax\odedevs-ode-841a072b124c\build\vs2010\ode.sln
- Right click any of the demo_* projects and click "Set as StartUp Prroject"
- Click "Local Windows Debugger" in the top bar of Visual Studio

Note: Currently demo_basket and demo_basket.cpp are being used as placeholders for code generated by ARMS until we figure out how to correctly create a new project and build it.
